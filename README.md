# TowerDefense2
Java tower defense :)

Version in dev. This is a learning project bugs are to be expected.
Non working versions (on last commit) are to be expected.

Modify assets2/map.data to change the map.
Warning only use valid symbols and keep the map a perfect square (ex 20 * 20)

pattern:
p p
p p

is not allowed as it can confuse the path finding (p representing a path case)
Also keep in mind that the path finding system is simple.
It will not handle multi-pathing / change in the first case of the path (0;6)!
